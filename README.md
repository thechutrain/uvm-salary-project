# UVM Salary Project

This is a python datascience project exploring all publically available salary data for University of Vermont employees over 20 years.  The goal of this project is to make the data more accessible for the public eye, and to even allow users to interact with the data through a json of the data in a browser. 

The data is available <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~oir/?Page=base_pay.html&SM=submenu_fac_staff.html">here</a>.
